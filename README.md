GRADUATION PROJECT

ABSTRACT:
In this graduation project, cryptographic hash functions with the use of multidimensional cellular automata have been implemented in software.
The software product implements construction of cryptographic sponge, utilized in the Keccak hashing algorithm, inner state of which has been created as three-dimensional cellular automata. The given diploma project presents a number of the sponge state permutation functions, developed with the use of processing rules of cellular automata and bitwise operations.
The created cryptographic hash functions possess satisfactory scattering properties and cause the occurrence of stable avalanche effect.
The main purpose of the developed software is to form a hash based on the input text information, which can be used to check the password phrase or to derive an electronic digital signature of the document.
